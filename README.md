# WP Activity Log

This composer library contains a series of base classes which can be used in a WordPress theme or plugin to generate a WordPress activity log. It is designed to allow the recording of meta data through custom field adapters such as ACF, the standard WP custom meta field hooks or expanded to your own implementation.

The activity log can be further expanded to house other data, sat outside of the WP meta hooks, but there are other plugins and also built in logging for some data types so this package does not try to fulfil all of these out of the box and instead focuses on postmeta hooks and data.

## Installation
